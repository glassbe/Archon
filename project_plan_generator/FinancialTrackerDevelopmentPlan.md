# Financial Tracker Development Plan

# Comprehensive Software Development Plan for a Financial Tracker Web Application

## 1. Project Overview

### Application Purpose
The financial tracker web application aims to empower users, particularly young professionals and small business owners, to effectively manage their finances by tracking income, controlling expenses, and monitoring investment portfolios in a user-friendly and secure environment. 

### Target Users
- **Young Professionals:** Individuals aged 20-35 managing personal finances, aiming for budgeting and saving.
- **Small Business Owners:** Entrepreneurs seeking to gain insight into their business finances, handle expenses, and track income.

### Key Objectives
- To provide a seamless and intuitive user experience that allows for real-time financial insights.
- To facilitate secure user authentication and connection to multiple financial accounts.
- To ensure data security and integrity while promoting easy access to financial information.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Frontend Technology Stack
- **Framework:** React.js (for a responsive and dynamic user interface)
- **State Management:** Redux (to manage application state)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (for a modern and customizable design)
- **Charting Libraries:** Chart.js (for visualizing financial data)

### Backend Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Node.js with Express.js (for building a scalable and efficient RESTful API)
- **Language:** JavaScript (for both frontend and backend consistency)
- **Handling Real-time Features:** Socket.IO (to achieve real-time data updates)

### Database Design
- **Database System:** PostgreSQL (for relational data management with ACID properties)
- **Schema Design:** 
  - Users Table: user_id, username, password_hash, email
  - Income Table: income_id, user_id, amount, source, date
  - Expenses Table: expense_id, user_id, amount, category, date
  - Investments Table: investment_id, user_id, asset, amount_invested, current_value

### Authentication Mechanism
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For secure stateless user authentication.
- **OAuth2:** To allow users to connect their bank accounts via third-party services (e.g., Plaid API).

### Deployment Strategy
- **Hosting:** AWS (Amazon Web Services) using EC2 for the backend, S3 for static file storage, and RDS for database hosting.
- **Containerization:** Docker for consistent environment across development and production.

- Create RESTful backend API for data interaction.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and Integrations
- Add investment tracking and analytical reporting features.
- Integrate bank account connection APIs.
- Implement real-time updates using Socket.IO.

### Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance
- Conduct unit testing and integration testing.
- Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with target users for feedback.
- Fix identified issues and polish UI/UX.

### Phase 5: Deployment and Initial Launch
- Deploy on AWS with a rollback plan.
- Monitor system performance and user feedback for improvements.
- Implement analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) for usage tracking.

## 5. Security Considerations

### Data Encryption
- Use TLS encryption for data in transit.
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords via bcrypt) before storing.

### Secure Authentication
- Implement strong password policies and account lockout mechanisms.
- Utilize JWT for secure sessions.

### Compliance Requirements
- Ensure compliance with GDPA / CCPA for user data handling.
- Liaise with legal advisors for financial data compliance.

### Privacy Protection
- Provide users with clear privacy policies and data usage disclosures.
- Implement user consent for data sharing with third parties.

## 6. Performance Optimization Strategies

### Caching Mechanisms
- Use Redis for caching frequent queries to improve response times.
- Implement client-side caching for static assets.

### Database Query Optimization
- Optimize SQL queries for performance with indexing and query analysis.
- Utilize pagination for managing large datasets in applications.

### Frontend Performance Techniques
- Minimize bundle size with code splitting and lazy loading.
- Optimize images and assets to reduce load times.

## 7. Scalability Planning

### Horizontal Scaling Approach
- Ensure the application is stateless for easy replication across multiple servers.
- Utilize shared databases or sharding for data distribution.

### Cloud Infrastructure Recommendations
- AWS services like Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling to manage traffic.

### Load Balancing Strategies
- Implement Amazon ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) to distribute incoming traffic effectively.
- Monitor server load and adjust capacity dynamically.

## 8. Estimated Resources and Timeline

### Recommended Team Composition
- 1 Project Manager
- 1 Backend Developer
